# The Global Reception: Do Adaptations Translate Well Across Borders?

A story may begin in a writer’s study, but when it reaches the screen, it becomes a global affair. From Hollywood blockbusters to Bollywood epics, adaptations cross borders, languages, and cultures. But do they resonate equally across continents?

Here, we explore how adaptations perform on the international stage. Do audiences in Europe embrace the same adaptations as those in Asia or America?
